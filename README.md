### Description:
We are not Japanese or translators, but we decided to pick this up as a side 
project due to a huge amount of requests.
This will ONLY be a UI translation as of right now, this may or may not change.

This is our second translation attempt and we will do the best we can.
If you have any questions feel free to contact us.

## Version: 1.1

### Installation:
Option 1 -> Using LumaFS
1. Place the patch's files into the /luma/titles/<titleID>folder on your SD card
2. Game titleIDs are 16 characters long and start with 00040000
- Medabee Ver. - 0004000000174E00
- Rokusho Ver. - 0004000000174F00

### Extra Notes
3. Update files need to be installed with the update cia. Lumafs
will only work for the base game files. I'm not sure and have not
tested whether all files will work installed via update cia.

Option 2 -> Using Cia
1. Decrypt then Extract CIA file
2. Replace files with in the romfs + exefs
3. Rebuild and install
